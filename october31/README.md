## Reading Response 
### (Eight Lessons Learned about Non-verbal Interactions through Robot Theater)


**Questions**

How can the audience assist the actor or robot?


**Observations**

One thing that I found very interesting in this reading is Lesson 7. I for one never thought of the importance of the audience in performances. I mean yes the whole thing is made for them, but I never thought of how big of a role they play in the performance too. With robots performing, I believe that the audience's interaction and feedback is very important, as it si mentioned in the reading. Therefore, thats when I started thinking of the script we wrote for our final performance, and I kept thinking if the robots seem too absorbed into their own world that the audience would feel left out. Should all performing robots break the fourth wall often to establish a connnection with the audience? Would the audience feel more distant if that were the case? 

**Reaction**

Another interesting reading that lays out the various things we can learn from performing robots.
