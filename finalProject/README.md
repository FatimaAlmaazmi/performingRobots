# Final Project
## Imaginary Friend Robot (Ima)


### Planning

![]()

This is the design we decided to work on for the imgainary friend robot. Since, the imaginary friend was such an open ended character, we decided to play around in terms of what it looked like, and to make it as magical and imaginary as possible.

The next part was deciding what goes where. The top part of the robot or its head, would hold the music maker sheild (for speech), the neopixels (x4 for eyes), and the servo motors (x2 for ears).


### Building
#### Body

Building the bottom part of the robot was simple, as we have done it before with our previous robots. One thing we changed was the motors, from the fast motors to the slower ones. This turned out very effective in controlling the robots movements for the performance.

Since the robot had a boxy shape tyo it, building it was pretty easy and straightforward, and we heavily relied on the triangle mounts or supports to support the structure of the robot. Plus, we cut out a door in the back for easy access to the electronics.

#### Head

As for building the head. Attaching the servo motors was a bit confusing at first, but we eventually got around to understadn how it works and how to attach it properly with the help of the professor.

We created a slot for the servo motor to go through and attached the ears accordingly.

Attaching and wiring the neopixels was quite simple. And here is what the robot looked after:

And after painting it and adding final touches like slinkies for arms and cotton balls to make it more magical and imaginary-like:

### Coding

Here is where most of the work was put in. 

One main problem that we encountered with the robot was trying to figure out how to turn on all 4 of the neopixel panels. Unfortunately, due the memory size of the arduino, it could only power up to two and a half neopixels with all of the other things we were working on, like the music maker shield, the radio, and the servo motors. I had to make a lot of compromises in terms of coding the eyes, like drawing stars that show up in places that actually do work on the neopixels.

see [video]() here of compromise.

However, in the last week before the performance, we decided as a class to let go of the music maker sheild, because it was taking too much time off of our hands. This made working with the neopixels much easier, as I was then able to control all 4 after freeing up space on the arduino!

This allowed us to create different eye variations for the imaginary robot like excited eyes or talking eyes.

Everything else was very straightforward, and we finally got the robot to work!!

here are test run [videos]() of the robot before the perfomance :)

This was such an incredible experience, and we are very glad to have been a part of this amazing class! Thank you!!
