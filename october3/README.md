## (add robot name here)


For this assignment Omar and I made a body for our robot. We brainstormed ideas of what kind of body we wanted the robot to have, and we were set on making the shape non-anthropomorphic and more structural and abstract in a way.

By sketching a few ideas, we decided to go with a curved shape that ascends in height. And while working, we realized how the shape we chose was very mathmatical in a way, where it reminded us of graphs of integration and how to calculate the area under the curve:

Also, to visualize our project, Omar made a miniture version of it:

Here are pictures of our process:

When we tried to run the robot on the previous code that Dhabia and I had worked on, Omar and I really liked how the added wieght (and the little smily face) gave a whole new different feel for the robot, so we decided not to change the code, and make the robot run as it did before.

Here is the link to the video of the robot.

As you can see, from an anxious robot, the robot noew looks more playful, and its as if we gave it a new hairstyle :)

Thank you :)
