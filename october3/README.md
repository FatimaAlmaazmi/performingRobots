## (add robot name here)


For this assignment Omar and I made a body for our robot. We brainstormed ideas of what kind of body we wanted the robot to have, and we were set on making the shape non-anthropomorphic and more structural and abstract in a way.

By sketching a few ideas, we decided to go with a curved shape that ascends in height. And while working, we realized how the shape we chose was very mathmatical in a way, where it reminded us of graphs of integration and how to calculate the area under the curve:

Also, to visualize our project, Omar made a miniture version of it:

Here are pictures of our process:

When we tried to run the robot on the previous code that Dhabia and I had worked on, Omar and I really liked how the added wieght (and the little smily face) gave a whole new different feel for the robot, so we decided not to change the code, and make the robot run as it did before.

Here is the ![link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11zR8JI-JhbW-4N42G1MSLEHbDNuwETxK/view?usp=sharing) to the video of the robot.

As you can see, from an anxious robot, the robot noew looks more playful, and its as if we gave it a new hairstyle :)

Thank you :)
