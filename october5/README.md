### (The Freudian Robot: Digital Media and the Future of the Unconscious)


**Questions**

what really is a Freudian robot, and where do we draw the line?



**Observations**

This is a really interesting reading, but my mind is going through an information overload. The author brings up so many intriguing points about robots and automatans and how the world and roboticists view these machines and our morals and philosophies about them. From explaining the difference between a robot and an automatan (which I thought were the exact same), to introducing us to a Freudian robot, and to also discussing how the root of the word 'robot' is derived from the word 'slave' in Czech. I guess you can see why this reading felt like an information overload.
Nevertheless, the points she brings up are very thought-provoking, it really put into perspective a lot of things I had thought about robots. But, what bothered me is that I still don't really understand what a Freudian robot is, and what distinguishes it from everything else? Why do we need this new term? 
I think they even point out how there could be no line to draw, when they mentioned how even humans who understand the language of machines or are cyber-literate could also turn into Freudian robots. I guess that's where my confusion sorts of stems from too. They also mention that the Freudian robot need not to be made of plastic or any other material because it redoubles the image of flesh-and-blood humans? I don't know I was so confused. It felt as though they were just describing a cyborg? I could be totally wrong about this, and I could be reading this whole thing wrong too. I hope I get some clarifications in class :)
