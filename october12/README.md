## Production Assignment

For this production assignemnt, we made our robot remote controlled using the Hobby RC.

We practiced driving the robot around, and tried several ways to troubleshoot the steering and speed of the robot to finally control and drive it better.

Here are [videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uYwGJwSdMqsyIlzvUqQ7R844JZ1VJ_q1?usp=sharing) of our practice runs.


For our speech practice, we wanted to create something that in a way would bring our robot to life. With the way it looked while we drove it around, it carried a sort of radiance of innocence around it. We drove it outside, and the feeling resonated a lot with us, it was as though it was experiencing life, and was in awe of everything around it.

So our concept was based around the realities of a robot's life. We found a poem online by Kenneth Samuels that reads:

"I was born to be free without these shackles or chains. To speak my mothers tounge without prejudice or restraint. I was born to be free to grow from a boy to a man. Without being controlled, branded, beaten, or wiped by the wicked masters hand. I was born to be free so I should not have to live my life in contstant hurt, fear or pain. And be robbed from my native land never to see my mother or father and siblings ever again."

We randomly found this online, and filmed the video of the robot, and we felt that this poem about slavery resembles the what our little robot could be experiencing somehow. I guess we made a very very deep video about robots and the morals and ethics of their existence.

We also edited the video to distort it a bit and amplify the robot-ness of it.

Thank you :)

## Reading Response 
### (Thinking Something Makes it So)


**Questions**

why do we need performing robots?
do they need to resemble humans if they do perform?
how important is the form of a robot?


**Observations**

This could be the best reading out of all the readings because it actually lays down answers with the questions. I don't know why it just flew past my mind the way I used to look at the whole "robots imitating humans" and the reason behind that. When I took Robota Psyche, I was adamant that the only reason why humans make robotos similar to us is because through them we can begin to understand ourselves. And that was also outlined in the reading, and it just all made sense again to me. Throughout all of my reading responses, all of my questions were along the line of "why do we make robots similar to us and whether that is really necessary?" and now finally I feel like I have an answer. The reason why we're so adamant at making them similar to us, allowing them to mimick us in plays and theatre, like the ones mentioned in the reading by Hirata and Ishiguro.
We barely understand oursleves, and through them we get a glimpse of our humanity, naivness, and even innocence sometimes. I was so caught up in other readings about robots that mention narcisisim and god-complex and how that sort of pushes us to make the impossible by making them look like us. But in the end I feel that we just want to see ourselves projected onto this mechanical other and ponder our existence and humanity.

**Reaction**

I really like this reading. It feels as though it woke me up.
