## Reading Response 
### (Chapter 6: Robots: Digital Theatre.)


**Questions**

How close should a robot resemble humans for them to form a connection with it?



**Observations**

I accidentally did the first part of the reading, which discusses digital puppets, and I found the examples to be very interesting when comparing it to the other part of the reading which discusses mechanical actors. The only example that caught my attention was of the AI Jeremiah, who responds to the actor's movements by showing emotions of happiness, sadness and such. What really intrigued me about this type of AI is how people were able to connect with it, where they were trying to please it and make it happy by moving around, regardless of it being a digital entity. I know that there is no doubt that mechanical actors like robots do allow us to feel morer connected and the interaction will most certtainly be easier and more fluid because of how familiar it is. But, I just find it fascinating how we can also trigger our empathy for inanimate and digital objects and beings by giving it the most basic form of humanity.

**Reaction**

Very interesting reading, I really liked the examples they brought up, I just wish they had linked them so I could watch videos or see photos of what they were referring to. But all in all very insightful :)
